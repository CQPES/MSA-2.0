# a (length-scale)    E0 (weight)
       2.0               0.04

# explanation
# (1) length scale: the internuclear distances are transformed to Morse variables as
#     yij = exp(-rij/a), and here a is the length-scale parameter. The recommended
#     value is between 2.0 and 3.0 bohr.
#
# (2) weight: the user can assign a weight to each data point, based on its energy.
#     The weight is given by wt=E0/(E0+dE), where dE is the energy relative to the
#     minimum in hartree, and E0 is the parameter that the user could modify.
#
# The default values are:
#  a = 2.d0 (bohr)
#  E0 = 1e+10 (all the weights are essentially 1)
